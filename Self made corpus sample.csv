The Idiot	War and Peace
He could not understand how he could have been so foolishly trusting.	Before dinner Princess Marya and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humour, stood awaiting him;
The prince knew that of all the Epanchins the only one he might find in town now was the general, because of his official duties, and that, too, was unlikely.	After his interview with his wife, Pierre left for Petersburg
The prince was very worried as he went upstairs and tried as hard as he could to encourage himself.	Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with others.
When the prince fell silent, they all looked at him gaily, even Aglaya, but especially Lizaveta Prokofyevna.	Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as he did, as much as possible by signs.
General Ivan Fyodorovich Epanchin was standing in the middle of his office, looking with extreme curiosity at the entering prince, and even took two steps towards him. 	His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or moustache, evidently not because he had shaven, but because they had never grown.
Nastasya Filippovna's arrival, especially at the present moment, was a most strange and bothersome surprise for them all.	‘Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,’ said Count Rastopchin, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. 
It seemed the poor boy was no longer able to leave him alone.	On the 11th of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostovs’, promised to come to dinner next day.
Suddenly Lizaveta Prokofyevna came to him on the terrace alone.	‘We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed,* your Excellency,’ said Timokhin, timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel.
For a moment he tried to suppress an unbearable fit of laughter	‘Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,’ said Prince Andrei with venomous irony.
Meanwhile Lebedev, flushed and nearly ecstatic, ran up to him with explanations; he was rather well loaded.	Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.
"""I've been especially waiting for you, and I'm terribly glad you've come so happy,"""	The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.
